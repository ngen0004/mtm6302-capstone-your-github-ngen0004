Quiz Site Project

This project will have 5 pages
the home page which shows the landing page with a button to start
Once the user clicks on the start button, it will display the difficulty page where the user has 
to select a category, difficulty level (easy, medium and hard) and the number of question they want.

After clicking on the submit button, it will go to the page of questions.
The question will be multiple choices and the user will have to select answers.
The user will click on the submit answer button and it will display a message if the selected answer is
correct or incorrect, then it will give the user the option to select a difficulty level.

The last page will display the score, and correct answers of the questions and the grade optained after answering all the questions.

I will be displaying the quiz application in desktop screen size and mobile screen size


Part 3:
During the process of building this quiz prototype, I changed the look of the mockup to make it more easy to navigate and be interactive.
The updated prototype is made up of 3 pages; The home/index page, questions page, and result page. On the home page I changed the design with 3 links to choose a difficulty level of questions, after the user clicks on the level it will display the questions page. On the questions page, I changed the design of the page and added two boxes, one that displays question and second one that displays the feedback after selecting the answer and this will give the user a chance to select another difficulty level of questions. On the result page I changed the design and displayed only the score and correct answers.

I used basic html tags to create the 3 pages and some classes to design the prototype to match the mockup in a css file (style.css)
In the css file I added a media query to make the prototype more interactive when displaying on different screen sizes (desktop and mobile)

In the head section of html pages, I used a font awesome internet icon library to display an icon in the footer section (copyright icon).
